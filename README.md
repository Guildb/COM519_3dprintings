## To be able to login I did create a default user

## Username: guildb

## Password: Renatosilva1

This user will have a few orders processed to display the chart and the red and green cards in the dashboard. As the production environment is not functioning properly, you will be able to login and access the dashboard and still see this chart and the cards, but you will be unable to perform any other actions as the cyclic will reload the entire programme.
